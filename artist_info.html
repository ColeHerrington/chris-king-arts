            <h1 id="story-title">My Story</h1>
            <p>
                I am a University of North Texas graduate majoring in Drawing and Painting. 
                My educational aspirations consist of acquiring a bachelor's degree in 
                fine arts and minoring in art history; this will help me pursue a career 
                as an illustrator. I hope to make a career by providing illustrations for books, 
                comics, and graphic designs because of the importance of what illustrations 
                meant to me in elementary school.<br><br>
                
                I was diagnosed with dyslexia as a child. 
                Dyslexia caused me to struggle with reading and writing and have a 
                lower reading level than most students in elementary school. 
                The only books I could understand were the books with illustrations. 
                I loved storytelling, but I was never great with my words, so I began to draw. 
                Ever since then, it has been a goal of mine to accomplish a career as an artist.
